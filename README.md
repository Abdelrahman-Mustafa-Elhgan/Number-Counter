# Number-Counter
A program that counts how many times a specific number appears in a list of entered numbers.

# 🔢 NumberCounter  
A simple C++ program that counts how many times a specific number appears in a list of user-inputted numbers.

## 📄 Description  
NumberCounter is a basic C++ console application that allows the user to input a custom list of numbers, then search for a specific number and display how many times it occurred. The program demonstrates how to use arrays, loops, conditionals, and user interaction to solve a real-world-style task in a simple way.

## ✨ Features  
✅ User inputs any number of elements  
✅ Allows searching for any number in the list  
✅ Counts and displays how many times the number appears  
✅ Simple, fast, and beginner-friendly logic  
✅ Teaches basic array usage and input/output in C++

## 💡 Example  
User enters number of elements → Enters the actual numbers → Enters the number to search for → Program displays how many times it occurred.



Show positions (indexes) of found numbers

Store data in files

Add user interface using libraries like ncurses or a GUI toolkit


## 🎯 Purpose  
This project helps beginners practice:

- For-loops and array traversal  
- Using `if` conditions  
- Basic counting algorithms  
- Console-based input/output  
- Writing clear and structured logic

## 🛠️ Technologies  
- C++ Programming Language  
- Console Input/Output (cin, cout)  
- Arrays and loops  
- Conditional statements (`if`)  

## 📚 License  
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
